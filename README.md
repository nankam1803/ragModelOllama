ðŸ“¦ Project Setup & Installation

This guide will help you quickly set up your Python project, including creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and running the application.

âœ… Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository from GitHub:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>

Replace <your-repo-url> and <your-repo-name> with your actual repository information.

âœ… Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment named .venv:

Windows:

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

âœ… Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python libraries using the provided requirements.txt file:

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

âœ… Step 4: Run the Application

Run your Python script or application:

python ragModel.py

Make sure to replace ragModel.py with your actual Python script filename.
